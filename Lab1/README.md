# Lab 1
This lab includes many different functions to answer different questions in `Questions.c` as well as their respective test cases in `testCases.c`.
- Question 1 involves writing a for, while, and do-while loop that returns the integer sum of all the numbers that are multiples a specified user input between 1 and 1000.
- Question 2 involves a function returning different outputs based on a normal and threshold input of the user.
- Question 3 involves a function that finds every perfect number up to a user specified limit.
- Question 4 involves writing a Bubble sort algorithm.

Flowchart images for each question are attached under the `flowcharts` directory.
