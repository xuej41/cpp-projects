# Lab 2

This lab involved writing custom Linked List functions for an existing snake game that used an Array List, and measuring the time complexities of head insertion and tail deletion.

The report for this lab can be viewed at `Lab2_Report.pdf`.

Additionaly, you can type `make` under `/Lab1-Model (Improved)/src` and run `Project.exe` that appears under `/Lab1-Model (Improved)/bin` to run the game yourself and view the times for head insertion and deletion. To modify the test parameters yourself, go to `Player.cpp` and simply modify TEST_LENGTH under line 9, change the Array/Linked List being called under line 15, as well as comment and uncomment  `gmRef->StartMeasurement/endMeasurementAndRecord` under lines 111, 113, 116, and 118.
