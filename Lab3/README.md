# Lab 3
This lab includes many different functions to answer different questions in `Questions.c` as well as their respective test cases in `testCases.c`.
- Question 1 involves writing a custom string library to be used in Question 2, and in the future, PPA3.
    - This includes many different functions such strlen (string length), strcmp (string comparison), strcmpOrder (string comparison and ordering), and strcat (concatenating two strings).
- Question 2 involves reading a text file `wordlist.txt` and writing several functions to arrange the contents. The string library from question 1 is used to help acheive this.
- The question also contains a faulty implementation of a selection sort algorithm, which is corrected using the VSCode IDE debugger. The debugging report can be viewed at `Q2_SelectionSort_Debugging_Report.pdf`.
