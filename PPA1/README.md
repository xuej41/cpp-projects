# Project Preparation Activity 1

My first project preparation activity lab. This activity includes a Marquee Display (Rolling Banner), run in the CLI, where you can add up to 16 ASCII characters and change the direction of the flow of text.

Type `make` in the terminal and run the `./PPA1.exe` executable that compiles. Copied from COE2SH4-F2024 on GitHub Classroom.
