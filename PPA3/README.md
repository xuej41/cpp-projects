# Project Preparation Activity 3

This activity includes a player whose direction and speed you can control using the w,a,s,d and +,- keys on the keyboard.
The goal of the game is to collect all the characters in the mystery string in as little moves as possible. 5 random characters are generated at once -- 2 from the mystery string, and 3 random distraction ascii characters. As soon as the player collects one character, 5 new characters spawn.
The game is run in the terminal.

Type `make` in the terminal and run the `./PPA2.exe` executable that compiles. Enjoy!
