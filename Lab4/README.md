# Lab 4
This lab includes many different functions to answer different questions in `Matrix.cpp`, as well as implementing more functions in `Matrix.h`.

- This lab involved creating several different constructors, being default, copy, custom constructors, copy assignment operators, destructors, and more.
- More functions were implemented to increase the functionality of the Matrix class. Examples include Matrix::getElement, Matrix::setElement, Matrix::subMatrix, and Matrix::toString.
- The question also contains a faulty implementation of a matrix copying function Matrix::copy, which was corrected using the `cout` statements and logical resoning. The debugging report can be viewed at `Matrix_copy_Debugging_Report.pdf`.
