# Lab 2
This lab includes many different functions to answer different questions in `Questions.c` as well as their respective test cases in `testCases.c`.
Question 1 involves vector addition, dot product, and normalizing vectors.
Question 2 involves rearragning a 3x3 matrix into a vector using an anti-diagonal scanning order.
Question 3 involves rearragning a linear vector of integers into a Struct vector with the integer value and position relative to the linear vector.
Question 4 involves correcting a faulty Bubble sort algorithm using the VSCode IDE debugger. The debugging report can be viewed at `Q4_Debugging_Report.pdf`. The question also involves writing a Selection sort algorithm which acheives the same output as Bubble sort but with fewer steps.
